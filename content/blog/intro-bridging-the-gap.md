description: "I recently met a brilliant junior engineer who was an expert in AI and Cloud Security but missed one critical element: the underlying architecture. In an era where a few clicks in a GUI can deploy an entire infrastructure, we are losing the "why" behind the "how." I’m opening up my private log of production incidents and "battle scars" to explain why fundamental principles still dictate project success—and how ignoring them leads to bloated costs and outages.

[Intro] Bridging the Gap: Why I am Documenting Fundamentals and Real-World Incidents

## 다음 섹션

Throughout my career, my primary focus has always been on **precision and speed of execution**. I have always been a process-driven person—investing heavily in planning, implementation, and rigorous validation whenever the timeline allowed. Because I ensured every project was backed by comprehensive documentation, I used to believe that further explanation was redundant. I let the **deliverables** speak for themselves.

However, after transitioning through several organizations and navigating the evolving tech landscape, I’ve noticed a growing disconnect in **knowledge transfer**. Technology is advancing at an exponential rate, but "legacy" concepts are not simply disappearing—they are the **bedrock** of modern innovation. When the foundation is overlooked, even the most sophisticated stack becomes a liability.

**Recently, I had the opportunity to work with a smart junior coworker. He was well-versed in the latest trends like Cloud Security, AI, and Multi Context Protocol (MCP). His drive was impressive, but during our technical deep dives, I realized he was often missing the fundamental architectural principles that drive project success.**

In today’s ecosystem, vendor-provided GUIs and managed services make deployment look deceptively simple. However, adopting these tools without a deep understanding of the underlying logic leads to **inefficient resource allocation**, inflated operational costs, and latent risks that can trigger major outages. These are the critical nuances that aren't always covered in standard training but are learned through "battle scars" in production.

In an era of information overload, there is still a shortage of **practical, field-tested insights**. This is why I have decided to document the incidents I’ve managed and the operational know-how I’ve gathered on the ground.

Some of the decisions we made in the past might not align with today’s "best practices," but they were the most strategic choices given the constraints of that time. I view this not just as a technical log, but as a **shared legacy**. I am writing this for the next generation of engineers and leaders, with the same mentorship-driven mindset I bring to my own team.
